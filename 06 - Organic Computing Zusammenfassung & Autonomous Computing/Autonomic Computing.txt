= Autonomic Computing

== Zusammenfassung des Artikels über IBM

* Coming from the Software Complexity Crysis
** Systems approaching the limits of human capability
* Autonomic Computing (to the rescue)
** System manages itself given high-level objectives
*** Under changing circumstances
*** Under software failures
** Autonomic nervous system analogy (manages low-level human functionality like
breathing to decrease cognitive load)

=== 4 aspects

CHOP +
These can be worked on seperately

* Self-Configuration
** in accordance to high-level policies
** rest of the system adapts to its presence
** registers its capatibilities
* Self-Healing
** diagnose problems (regression testing, logfiles)
** repair them
** retest
* Self-Optimization
** experiment with own parameters, measure gains and losses
* Self-Protection
** defend from attacks
** anticipate problems based on early reports from sensors and apply
countermeasures

=== Structure

* Autonomic Elements
** One Autonomic Manager
*** manages the element(s)
*** encapsulates the functionality of the element(s)
*** constructs and executes plans
*** communicates with peer AEs
** One or more Managed Elements
*** hardware resource (CPU, storage, printer, &c.)
*** software resource (database, dir service, legacy system, &c.)

=== Relationship Management

Connection resolving:: Hard-wired ↦ Physical Address ↦ Name ↦ Function

* Automatic reaction to service requests, if consistent with goals
* Automatic issueing of requests based on goals
* NO-API
* Autonomic Elements are Agents, system is Multi-Agent System
